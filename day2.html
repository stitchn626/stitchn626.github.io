    <p>This repository documents my journey of learning HTML, the foundation of building web pages. The goal is to understand HTML structure, tags, and best practices for creating clean, semantic web pages. This project serves both as a learning record and a practical portfolio of code examples and mini-projects.</p>
     <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design the structure of web pages. Every website on the internet uses HTML in some form, making it a fundamental skill for web development.
</p>
    <h2>Basic Structure of HTML </h2>
    <p>HTML provides the basic structure of web pages using tags and elements. It tells the browser how to display text, images, links, forms, and other content.
</p>
   <h4>Tags and Elements:</h4>
<p>HTML uses tags like &lt;p&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, etc., to mark different parts of a webpage.</p>
